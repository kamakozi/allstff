<h1>Education</h1>

<p>Throughout my academic career, I encountered several obstacles that hindered my ability to thrive within a traditional educational environment. Despite my struggles, I remained steadfast in my pursuit of discovering my true passions and path in life.</p>

<p>Upon completing my elementary education, I ventured into the realm of trade school, although I found myself lacking the motivation and drive to succeed within this field. However, I was determined to leverage my passion for technology to discover my true calling.</p>

<p>As such, I delved into a wide range of programming languages, including Python, Java, HTML, CSS, C#, and C++, in an attempt to discover my niche within computer science. Despite my foray into various disciplines, I ultimately found my calling in web development.</p>

<p>Following the completion of my three-year tenure at trade school, I sought to augment my knowledge and capabilities by pursuing two years of education at an esteemed economic school. Through my journey in academia, I have come to realize that success is not measured solely by academic prowess, but also by one's ability to harness their passions and carve out their unique niche within the industry.</p>
