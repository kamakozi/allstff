<h1>My life</h1>

<p>Greetings, my name is Ziga Zoric and I was born in Slovenia on September 3rd, 2000. From a young age, I have had a deep interest in technology and have always been captivated by the possibilities it offers. This passion has driven me to explore various aspects of the digital world, from building computers and creating games to experimenting with video and audio software.</p>

<p>Throughout my journey, I have experimented with various programming languages such as Python, but I never truly found my calling until I discovered web development. The world of web development allows me to merge my creative and technical skills to craft beautiful, interactive, and user-friendly websites. I have delved deeply into the field, honing my skills in languages such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and many others.</p>

<p>My proficiency in web development has allowed me to engage with my passion on a whole new level. I am fascinated by the way that web development can combine elements of art and science to create something truly unique and functional. In fact, I have found web development to be the most enjoyable aspect of my exploration of technology so far.</p>

<p>As I continue to expand my knowledge and experience in the field of web development, I am excited about the possibilities that lie ahead. I am eager to use my skills to create innovative and dynamic websites that serve the needs of clients and users alike.</p>
